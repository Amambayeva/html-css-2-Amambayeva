CSS resets are used to override the default stylesheets
that modern browsers use. Because each browser uses a different
stylesheet, certain elements (submit buttons, links, etc) don’t
always have consistent styling across all browsers. A CSS reset
 will wipe out some of the browser’s default styling by
 replacing it with a set of completely customizable style rules
 for all of the basic HTML elements so that each element will
 appear the same, regardless of whether they’re viewed on
 Chrome or Firefox. There are many different CSS resets out
 there, each one with a different set of reset styles, but
 typically a reset will clear most elements of any margins
 and paddings, remove borders and list styles, and reverts
 font-size and line-height to 100%. Here’s a comprehensive
 list of some of the best resets available.
